# nasnet-tensorflow
A nasnet in tensorflow based on tensorflow [slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim) library.

With this repo. you should be able to:

--Train nasnet (nasnet-a-large, nasnet-a-mobile) for customized dataset for image classification problem from scratch (If you want).

--Finetune a nasnet from a pre-train model for customized dataset for image classification problem.

--Test and evaluate the model you have trained.

--Deploy the model for your application.

Nasnet is so far (initial version on ArXiv is released on 21 Jul. 2017) the state-of-the-art image classification architecture ImageNet dataset, the single crop accuracy for nasnet-large model is reported to be 82.7. For details of nasnet, please refer to paper [Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012) by Barret Zoph etc.
