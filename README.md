# nasnet-tensorflow

A nasnet in tensorflow based on tensorflow [slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim) library.


## About Nasnet and this repository

Nasnet is so far the state-of-the-art image classification architecture on ImageNet dataset (ArXiv release date is 21 Jul. 2017), the single crop accuracy for nasnet-large model is reported to be 82.7. For details of nasnet, please refer to paper [Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012) by Barret Zoph etc.

With this repo., you should be able to:

- Train a nasnet for customized dataset for image classification problem from scratch. (If you want)

- Finetune nasnet (nasnet-a-large, nasnet-a-mobile) from a pre-train model for image classification.

- Test and evaluate the model you have trained.

- Deploy the model for your application. (By your self)

Suitable for those who have solid CNN knowledge, python and tensorflow background. For those who have less background, [tensorflow slim walk through tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/slim_walkthrough.ipynb) should be a good start.


## Dependencies
tensorflow >= 1.4.0

tf.contrib.slim

numpy


## Usage
1. Clone the repo.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/yeephycho/nasnet-tensorflow.git
```

2. Download and converting to TFRecord format (This part is the same as tf.slim tutorial)
For each dataset, we'll need to download the raw data and convert it to
TensorFlow's native
[TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/python_io.html#tfrecords-format-details)
format. Each TFRecord contains a
[TF-Example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/core/example/example.proto)
protocol buffer. Below we demonstrate how to do this for the Flowers dataset.

```shell
$ DATA_DIR=/tmp/data/flowers
$ python download_and_convert_data.py \
    --dataset_name=flowers \
    --dataset_dir="${DATA_DIR}"
```

When the script finishes you will find several TFRecord files created:

```shell
$ ls ${DATA_DIR}
flowers_train-00000-of-00005.tfrecord
...
flowers_train-00004-of-00005.tfrecord
flowers_validation-00000-of-00005.tfrecord
...
flowers_validation-00004-of-00005.tfrecord
labels.txt
```

These represent the training and validation data, sharded over 5 files each.
You will also find the `$DATA_DIR/labels.txt` file which contains the mapping
from integer labels to class names.
